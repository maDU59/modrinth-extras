## 🚀 Installation

Install from your browser's extension store:

> [!NOTE]
> Store listings may currently be outdated. For the latest version, install manually from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/creeperkatze/modrinth-extras/releases).

- **[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/modrinth-extras/ajmkilipadfpaefpcjfgnkejalmhdlcj)**
- **[Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/modrinth-extras/)**
- **[Edge Add-Ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/modrinth-extras/jkfgnimibfpoohbmaibjdjdmfnjmbjcj)**

Or install manually from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/creeperkatze/modrinth-extras/releases):

1. Download the zip for your browser from the release assets.
2. **Chrome / Edge:** go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, then drag and drop the zip onto the page.
3. **Firefox:** go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, and select the zip. Note that Firefox removes the extension on browser restart since it is loaded as a temporary add-on.

## 🔒 Building from source

If you don't want to trust the store release, you can build the extension yourself directly from the source code and verify it matches what's in this repository.

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

```bash
# Clone and check out the version you want to verify (e.g. v1.0.11)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/creeperkatze/modrinth-extras.git
cd modrinth-extras
git checkout v1.0.11

pnpm install

# Chrome / Edge
pnpm zip

# Firefox
pnpm zip:firefox
```

The resulting zips in `.output/` are identical to those attached to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/creeperkatze/modrinth-extras/releases) for that tag. See the [Installation](#-installation) section for instructions on loading the zip in your browser.

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--recurse-submodules` flag is required as the project imports packages from the [modrinth](https://github.com/modrinth/code) monorepo as a git submodule.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/creeperkatze/modrinth-extras.git
cd modrinth-extras

pnpm install
```

### Chrome

```bash
pnpm build
```

Then go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select the `.output/chrome-mv3` folder. After rebuilding, just click on the reload icon.

### Firefox

```bash
pnpm zip:firefox
```

Then go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, and select the zip from the `.output/` folder. After rebuilding, repeat this process.

> [!NOTE]
> `pnpm dev` can also be used during development to automatically create a temporary browser with the extension pre-loaded. Keep in mind that this browser profile is isolated, requiring you to log in each time. This method also causes issues with Modrinth's dependencies.
